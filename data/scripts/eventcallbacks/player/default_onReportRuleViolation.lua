-- targetName arrives straight off the network packet (src/protocolgame.cpp)
-- with no server-side validation before this event fires — it is used
-- directly to build a filesystem path below, so a crafted report packet
-- could otherwise write to an arbitrary path via "../" or "/" in the name.
-- Real Tibia player names are letters/spaces (occasionally an apostrophe or
-- hyphen for legacy imports); reject anything that doesn't match rather
-- than trying to strip it, since a silently-modified name could still
-- collide with another report's file.
